# MinHeap
 1, master the operation method of the priority queue 2, master the minimum heap storage structure and the implementation of related operations 3, master the role and performance of the minimum heap in the priority queue Experimental content: Assuming that there are n data objects (n>=100), n random numbers are now generated as the priority of the n objects, and the smaller the value, the higher the priority. Let the n objects enter the team and then dequeue according to the priority level. The rule is: the object with high priority is first out. To achieve the above operation, the possible solutions are as follows: Solution 1: Let n objects enter the queue in turn, and then search the queue according to the priority of the object when the team is drawn, and find out the elements with high priority. Option 2: N objects are sorted by priority using direct insertion sorting or direct selection sorting method that they have learned, and then dequeued in turn. Solution 3: Build the minimum heap of n objects, and then let the root node elements dequeue, and re-adjust the elements in the queue to the minimum heap after each dequeue operation.
